# XAML_Project

This repository includes an API and a XAML project dedicated to managing assignments for consultants in a company.

Potential user of the app is a project manager or assignments manager.

In the app user can ADD and EDIT assignments and see a list of companies. 

**To try the project please start the backend project and run Update-Database command in the Nuget Console. Add the example data to the database with the query from the file (the project database is called ProjectX). Now you can run the frontend!** 

Nota Bene: With first edit of the assignment please click any assignment and press cancel to trigger the page-update. It needs to be done only once! :-)
